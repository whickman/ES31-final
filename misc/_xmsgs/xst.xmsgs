<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="3019" delta="new" >HDL ADVISOR - <arg fmt="%s" index="1">2048</arg> flip-flops were inferred for signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">weights</arg>&gt;. You may be trying to describe a RAM in a way that is incompatible with block and distributed RAM resources available on Xilinx devices, or with a specific template that is not supported. Please review the Xilinx resources documentation and the XST user manual for coding guidelines. Taking advantage of RAM resources will lead to improved device usage and reduced synthesis time.
